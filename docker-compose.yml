# A service definition contains configuration that is applied to each container started for that
# service, much like passing command-line parameters to docker container create. Likewise, network
# and volume definitions are analogous to docker network create and docker volume create.
services:
  cloudapp-config-server:
    # As with docker container create, options specified in the Dockerfile, such as CMD, EXPOSE,
    # VOLUME, ENV, are respected by default - you donâ€™t need to specify them again in
    # docker-compose.yml.
